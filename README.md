# SortFile

My assignment for week 6 for Fundamentals of Programming completed **20/12/2020**:

Write a program, called sort_file, which takes a text file as input and produces an output file which has all the original lines in alphabetical order.

The program should do the following:

•	Prompt the user for the names of the input and output files. You can prepare an input file with appropriate unsorted data. A simple file with one word per line will suffice.

•	Declare and define three functions to perform the following tasks:

1.	Read the data from the input file into an array.
2.	Sort the array using the bubble sort algorithm.
3.	Write the sorted data array to the output file.
